# Water Potability Prediction Project

## Introduction
This Data Science project aims to predict the potability of water using machine learning. Our goal is to assess water quality from various sources and develop models that can determine its safety for consumption. Through thorough data analysis and visualization, we seek to identify the key factors affecting water quality.

## Project Goals
1. Evaluate water potability from diverse sources.
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for dataset insights.
3. Develop predictive models for water potability.
4. Contribute to ensuring safe and clean water for communities.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** Examine water quality features, such as chemical composition and physical properties.
2. **Data Visualization:** Use visualization techniques to highlight patterns and relationships in the data.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Apply statistical methods to uncover correlations and dependencies.
4. **Model Development:** Build machine learning models based on EDA insights.
5. **Web Page:** Create a webpage using Streamlit to showcase the project.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Data Analysis Libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization Libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
