# Water Potability Prediction Project

## Introduction
This Data Science project focuses on predicting the potability of water using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. Our objective is to assess the quality of water from various sources and build predictive models that can determine whether it is safe for consumption. By thoroughly analyzing and visualizing the data, we aim to understand the critical factors influencing water quality.

## Project Goals
1. Assess water potability from diverse sources.
2. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
3. Build predictive models to determine the potability of water.
4. Contribute to ensuring access to safe and clean water sources for communities.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** We will delve into the dataset, examining features related to water quality, such as chemical composition and physical properties.

2. **Data Visualization:** Utilize various data visualization techniques to illustrate patterns and relationships within the data.

3. **Statistical Analysis:** Apply statistical methods to uncover correlations and dependencies in the dataset.

4. **Model Development:** Develop machine learning models to predict water potability based on the insights gained from EDA.
